I'm Danny from California, I like to analysis data and turn it into easy to visualizations that anyone can comprehend. I have worked a lot of with python through google colab and have been trying to get better at using R and SQL for data manipulation. I enjoy using Tableau as a source of data visualizations since it makes it simple and easy to understand. Using a tool like SQL has been great because I can turn data into usable data that can be visualized in tableau.
